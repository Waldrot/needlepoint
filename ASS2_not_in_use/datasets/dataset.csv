Towards a political economy of technical systems: The case of Google,"Rieder, Bernhard","big tech ; Google ; Materiality ; monopolization ; Operational definitions ; Social Sciences - Other Topics ; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary ; technical system","This research commentary proposes a conceptual framework for studying big tech companies as “technical systems” that organize much of their operation around the mastery and operationalization of key technologies that facilitate and drive their continuous expansion. Drawing on the study of Large Technical Systems (LTS), on the work of historian Bertrand Gille, and on the economics of General Purpose Technologies (GPTs), it outlines a way to study the “tech” in “big tech” more attentively, looking for compatibilities, synergies, and dependencies between the technologies created and deployed by these companies. Using Google as example, the paper shows how to interrogate software and hardware through the lens of transversal applicability, discusses software and hardware integration, and proposes the notion of “data amalgams” to contextualize and complicate the notion of data. The goal is to complement existing vectors of “big tech” critique with a perspective sensitive to the specific materialities of specific technologies and their possible consequences.",https://gslg-hb.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/46GSLG_BORAS/o2sdmu/cdi_doaj_primary_oai_doaj_org_article_77486e21498044cf828d83691df428dd
The power of qualitative research in the era of social media,"Branthwaite, Alan ; Patterson, Simon",Automated content analysis ; Brands ; Ethnography ; Public relations agencies ; Research methodology ; Social media monitoring ; Social research ; Studies,"Purpose - The electronic social media such as Twitter, Facebook, MySpace, etc. have become a major form of communication, and the expression of attitudes and opinions, for the general public. Recently, they have also become a source of data for market researchers. This paper aims to provide a critical look at the advantages and limitations of such an approach to understanding brand perceptions and attitudes in the market place. Although the social media provide a wealth of data for automated content analyses, this review questions the validity and reliability of this research approach, and concludes that social media monitoring (SMM) is a poor substitute for in-depth qualitative research which has many advantages and benefits.Design methodology approach - The paper presents a detailed, systematic comparison of various research approaches. These include well-established methods and recent inventions which are in use to explore and understand consumer behaviour and attitudes. Particular attention is given to the analysis of spontaneous consumer attitudes as expressed through the social media and also in qualitative research interviews.Findings - This analysis concludes that there are three critical features which differentiate qualitative research (as practised in IDIs and group discussions) from SMM. These are: the direct, interactive dialogue or conversation between consumers and researchers; the facility to ""listen"" and attend to the (sometimes unspoken) underlying narrative which connects consumers' needs and aspirations, personal goals and driving forces to behaviour and brand choice; and the dynamic, interactive characteristics of the interview that achieve a meeting of minds to produce a shared understanding. Philosophically, it is this ""conversation"" that gives qualitative research its validity and authenticity which makes it superior to SMM.Originality value - This review questions the validity and reliability of the SMM, and concludes that it is a poor substitute for in-depth qualitative research which has many advantages and benefits.",https://gslg-hb.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/46GSLG_BORAS/o2sdmu/cdi_emerald_primary_10_1108_13522751111163245
The power of code: women and the making of the digital world,"Klinger, Ulrike ; Svensson, Jakob",communication studies ; computer-mediated-communication ; ICTs,"Most research on gender and digital communication centers on how women use digital media, how they participate online, or how they are treated in online forums and social media. This article, in contrast, approaches gender from a behind the screen perspective. How algorithms and platforms are created, designed, and maintained, the affordances they provide for users and how they govern the ways users communicate with each other, has a major impact on digital communication. However, it is mostly men who create these technologies. Our study approaches technologies as socio-cultural, departing from the concept of network media logic. Empirically, it is based on (1) the review of a diverse body of literature from the history of programming, professional sociology, and computer science and documents such as the diversity reports from tech giants, as well as on (2) 64 semi-structured expert interviews conducted with male and female programmers in seven countries over a time-period of four years. Results show that the gender gap continues to run deep. We report results in four dimensions: professional culture, pervasive stereotypes, lack of role models and typical career paths.",https://gslg-hb.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/46GSLG_BORAS/o2sdmu/cdi_swepub_primary_oai_DiVA_org_mau_44886
The evolution of the code during review: an investigation on review changes,"Fregnan, Enrico ; Petrulio, Fernando ; Bacchelli, Alberto","Article ; Compilers ; Computer Science, Software Engineering ; Programming Languages ; Science & Technology ; Software Engineering/Programming and Operating Systems","Code review is a software engineering practice in which reviewers manually inspect the code written by a fellow developer and propose any change that is deemed necessary or useful. The main goal of code review is to improve the quality of the code under review. Despite the widespread use of code review, only a few studies focused on the investigation of its outcomes, for example, investigating the code changes that happen to the code under review. The goal of this paper is to expand our knowledge on the outcome of code review while re-evaluating results from previous work. To this aim, we analyze changes that happened during the review process, which we define as
 review changes
 . Considering three popular open-source software projects, we investigate the types of review changes (based on existing taxonomies) and what triggers them; also, we study which code factors in a code review are most related to the number of review changes. Our results show that the majority of changes relate to evolvability concerns, with a strong prevalence of documentation and structure changes at type-level. Furthermore, differently from past work, we found that the majority of review changes are not triggered by reviewers’ comments. Finally, we find that the number of review changes in a code review is related to the size of the initial patch as well as the new lines of code that it adds. However, other factors, such as lines deleted or the author of the review patchset, do not always show an empirically supported relationship with the number of changes.",https://gslg-hb.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/46GSLG_BORAS/o2sdmu/cdi_proquest_miscellaneous_2718637868
The ethical dimensions of Google autocomplete,"Graham, Rosie","Content management ; Ethical standards ; Holocaust ; Human influences ; Politics ; Resistance ; Social Sciences - Other Topics ; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary ; User satisfaction","Search engines no longer merely shape public understanding and access to the content of the World Wide Web: they shape public understanding of the world. Search engine results produced by secret, corporate-curated “search scripts” of algorithmic and human activity influence societies’ understanding of history, and current events. Society’s growing reliance on online platforms for information about current and historical events raises the stakes of search engines’ content moderation practices for information providers and seekers and society. Public controversies over the results returned by search engines to politically and morally charged queries evidence the growing importance, and politics, of corporations’ content moderation activities. Despite public concern with the political and moral impact of search engine results, search engine providers have resisted requests to alter their content moderation practices, responding instead with explanations, directions, and assistance that place responsibility for altering search results on information providers and seekers. This essay explores a public controversy around the results Google’s search engine returned to the query “did the holocaust happen” in order to understand how different imaginaries of the script of search contribute to the production of problematic results and shape perceptions of how to allocate responsibility for fixing it. Using Madeleine Akrich’s conception of a script—the roles and expectations prescribed to, and demanded of, the users by the designers of a technology—we unpack mismatches that fuel public objections to the results and corporate resistance to changing the script that produced them. Public objections are grounded in well-founded imaginaries of search engines not merely as providers of relevant information, but at least with respect to human rights atrocities such as the holocaust, as stewards of authoritative historical truth. Corporate resistance to altering the search script is rooted in a deep commitment to engineering logics which tether search engine performance to observational measures of user satisfaction, coupled with limited recognition of the role search results play in constructing the need being satisfied and a general reluctance to diverge from the search script to remove content protected by the First Amendment. Despite this resistance, we believe Google and other search engine providers are not completely wedded to the current search of script, just reluctant to move without clear guidance and concerned with the potential consequences of rescripting other speech. The essay concludes by offering a way forward grounded in developments in business and human rights. The emerging soft law requirement that businesses respect and remedy human rights violations entangled in their business operations provides a normative basis for rescripting search. The final section of this essay argues that the “right to truth,” increasingly recognized in human rights law as both an individual and collective right in the wake of human rights atrocities, is directly affected by Google and other search engine providers’ search script. Returning accurate information about human rights atrocities—specifically, historical facts established by a court of law or a truth commission established to document and remedy serious and systematic human rights violations—in response to queries about those human rights atrocities would make good on search engine providers’ obligations to respect human rights but keep adjudications of truth with politically legitimate expert decision makers. At the same time, the right to freedom of expression and access to information provides a basis for rejecting many other demands to deviate from the script of search. Thus, the business and human rights framework provides a moral and legal basis for rescripting search and for cabining that rescription.",https://gslg-hb.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/46GSLG_BORAS/o2sdmu/cdi_doaj_primary_oai_doaj_org_article_dc5930034ecd4ac0ae00b6f536cf2bdd
The anxious flâneur: Digital archiving and the Wayback Machine,"Hartelius, E. Johanna",archive ; browsing ; Digital archives ; Flaneur ; unheimlich ; Wayback Machine,"The Wayback Machine, the world's most extensive web archive, contains over 370 billion webpages dating to 1996. Yet despite its tagline, ""Universal Access to All Knowledge,"" overwhelmed visitors report frustration and trouble with keyword searching and site navigation. This essay uses the Wayback Machine to demonstrate how access as a digital archival ideal is realized only to the extent that it is defined in terms of delivery and not disposition. Further, I submit that the combination of copious delivery and a weak structure, or lack of meaningful arrangement, is conducive to flânerie, a perusal movement through digital objects. Contra the cultural imaginary of the flâneur as a figure of pleasure, I suggest that practices of flânerie generate an experience of displacement and angst. With reference to Martin Heidegger's concept of the unheimlich (uncanny), I characterize being in a web archive as immersive but anxiously placeless. I then rely on Heidegger again to identify a productively dispositional role for rhetoric in digital archiving. As logos, rhetoric builds a structure, or ""dwelling,"" that might provide orientation and make the archival unheimlich tolerable. The essay's implications pertain to the conditions of inhabitability in networked culture, which by design is functionally archival.",https://gslg-hb.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/46GSLG_BORAS/o2sdmu/cdi_proquest_journals_2456364536
Tech money in civil society: whose interests do digital rights organisations represent?,"Goldenfein, Jake ; Mann, Monique",Academic work ; Big Tech ; Cultural Studies ; cy pres ; digital rights ; Dominance ; Life Sciences & Biomedicine ; Perpetuation ; philanthrocapitalism ; Philanthropy ; Science & Technology ; Settlements & damages ; Tracking,"This article explores philanthropic interactions between 'Big Tech' and digital rights civil society organizations (DRCSOs) to enhance understanding of the alignment and misalignment of interests between these groups. 'Big Tech' wields political influence by distributing cash to research and policy organizations. Academic research supporting 'Big Tech' business practices is marshalled to support their political lobbying efforts, while civil society policy work shapes the narrative what dimensions of these businesses should be regulated (or not). While academic work is typically presented as a cool analysis of the relevant issues, DRCSOs purport to represent the interests of individuals and groups negatively affected by those business practices. Through empirical tracking of direct financial flows, as well as an analysis of cash distributions via class action litigation settlements, we show that certain DRCSOs have long-term financial relationships with 'Big Tech' that trouble our understanding of the alignments or misalignments of their interests. Through that analysis, we question where and how civil society fits into automated and algorithmic cultural production and perpetuation, and the way that Big Tech uses and guards the economic capital generated through its dominance over 'automated culture'.",https://gslg-hb.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/46GSLG_BORAS/o2sdmu/cdi_proquest_journals_2763960828
Smartphone Shadow Matching for Better Cross-street GNSS Positioning in Urban Environments,"Wang, Lei ; Groves, Paul D ; Ziebart, Marek K",Accuracy ; Global positioning systems ; GNSS ; GPS ; Matching ; Navigation systems ; Performance assessment ; Satellite systems ; Science & Technology ; Shadow Matching ; Shadows ; Smartphone ; Three dimensional models ; Urban Canyons ; Urban environments,"Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) shadow matching is a new positioning technique that determines position by comparing the measured signal availability and strength with predictions made using a three-dimensional (3D) city model. It complements conventional GNSS positioning and can significantly improve cross-street positioning accuracy in dense urban environments. This paper describes how shadow matching has been adapted to work on an Android smartphone and presents the first comprehensive performance assessment of smartphone GNSS shadow matching. Using GPS and GLONASS data recorded at 20 locations within central London, it is shown that shadow matching significantly outperforms conventional GNSS positioning in the cross-street direction. The success rate for obtaining a cross-street position accuracy within 5 m, enabling the correct side of a street to be determined, was 54·50% using shadow matching, compared to 24·77% for the conventional GNSS position. The likely performance of four-constellation shadow matching is predicted, the feasibility of a large-scale implementation of shadow matching is assessed, and some methods for improving performance are proposed. A further contribution is a signal-to-noise ratio analysis of the direct line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight signals received on a smartphone in a dense urban environment.",https://gslg-hb.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/46GSLG_BORAS/o2sdmu/cdi_proquest_miscellaneous_1685797652
Repurposing Digital Methods in a Post-API Research Environment: Methodological and Ethical Implications,"Caliandro, Alessandro",Emic and etic ; Methodological problems ; Research ethics,"Especially after the social media curtailing brought about the Cambridge Analytica scandal, it has become increasingly difficult to do social media research by using digital methods as well as following the medium. This condition brings in new methodological and ethical challenges. This article proposes some methodological strategies to 'repurpose' digital methods in a post-API research environment. The discussion draws on three case studies: 1) studying Instagram stories: the scraping dilemma; 2) studying smartphone in everyday contexts: researching digital environments not connected to APIs; 3) studying fake news on Twitter: dealing with increasingly useless APIs data. For each case study methodological and ethical implications are examined. In conclusion, the article suggests that a possible viable strategy to repurpose digital methods in a postAPI era is to follow the natives (along with the medium), that is, to take advantage of the natively digital methods through which social media users manage their own data as well as emic conception of what is ethical (or at least acceptable) regarding the handling of their own data.",https://gslg-hb.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/46GSLG_BORAS/o2sdmu/cdi_proquest_journals_2522189068

In this article we describe the emergence of the professional field of privacy engineering to enact this shift in digital governance. We argue that privacy engineering forms part of a broader techno-regulatory imaginary through which (fundamental) rights protections become increasingly future-oriented and anticipatory. The techno-regulatory imaginary is described in terms of three distinct privacy articulations, implemented in technologies, organizations, and standardizations. We pose two interrelated questions: What happens to rights as they become implemented and enacted in new sites, through new instruments and professional practices?

Results indicate that such coverage de-emphasized the non-advertising nature of Google News, ignored readers’ views, and used emotion-laden language (e.g., sensational accusations against Google of “stealing” newspaper content or being a “parasite”).

Order versus access: news search engines and the challenge to traditional journalistic roles,"Carlson, Matt",Access ; Google ; Journalistic authority ; New media,"This article examines tensions between new media forms and traditional journalistic practice through the rise of news search engines that index news stories from across the web. Specifically, Google News is taken up as a case study because of its popularity and its insistence on not using human editors. Conflicting normative articulations of journalism arise between traditional news and news search engines: the former promotes an interpretive order through purposefully structuring the news product to create a meaningful map of what is important, while the latter promotes diversity through creating easy access to different viewpoints and multiple versions of a story without legitimating one view over another.

Information governance in digitized public administration,"Brown, David C. G. ; Toze, Sandra",Disclosure ; Governance ; Technology application,"As the public sector increasingly transforms itself and its processes through digital technologies, information—the prime resource—the governance of information, and the need for advanced information skills, have moved to centre stage. Information governance processes form a critical bridge between the legacy systems of the past and the agile and mobile platforms of the future. Describing the forces at play, which include new information formats, modes of transmission and uses but also new skills and governance requirements, this article proposes an information governance‐centred research agenda. Considering information governance through a holistic lens is essential to ensure that the new possibilities available through technology can be leveraged to transform government, while government information itself is preserved as the essential tool for current and future government decision‐making, as a critical service to the public, as public memory, and as the foundation for public sector accountability and transparency.

 Alors que le secteur public et ses processus se transforment de plus en plus par le biais des technologies numériques, l'information – la première ressource – la gouvernance de l'information, et la nécessité d'avoir des compétences numériques de pointe sont parvenues au premier plan. Les processus d'information de la gouvernance constituent une passerelle cruciale entre les anciens systèmes et les plateformes agiles et mobiles de l'avenir. Cet article décrit les forces en jeu, qui comprennent des formats d'information, des modes de transmission et d'utilisation nouveaux, ainsi que de nouvelles compétences et exigences en matière de gouvernance; il propose un programme de recherche axé sur la gouvernance de l'information. Il est crucial d'aborder la gouvernance de l'information par une approche holistique afin d'assurer que les nouvelles possibilités offertes par la technologie puissent être mises à profit pour transformer le gouvernement, tandis que l'information gouvernementale est elle‐même préservée en tant qu'outil essentiel de prises de décision actuelles et futures, service fondamental au public, mémoire collective, et fondement pour l'imputabilité et la transparence du secteur public.",https://gslg-hb.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/46GSLG_BORAS/o2sdmu/cdi_wiley_primary_10_1111_capa_12227_CAPA12227
Inaccuracies in Low Income Housing Geocodes: When and Why They Matter,"Wilson, Nicole E. ; Hankinson, Michael ; Magazinnik, Asya ; Sands, Melissa",administrative data ; data audit ; geocoding ; Geographical coordinates ; Research applications ; Urban Studies,"Scholars across disciplines frequently employ data on housing developments subsidized by the National Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC). We find that the geographic coordinates for these developments, generated by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), are frequently inaccurate. Using both the population of data from California and a national sample, we find that HUD-provided geocodes are inaccurate nearly half the time while Google-generated geocodes are almost always more accurate. However, while Google’s geolocation is more likely to be accurate, when it is inaccurate, it deviates from the true location by a much greater distance than HUD. We therefore recommend that scholars use Google-generated geocodes for most research applications where the localized environment matters; however, in studies where observations are aggregated to a larger area, researchers may prefer to use HUD geocodes, which are more frequently inaccurate but typically by smaller distances.",https://gslg-hb.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/46GSLG_BORAS/o2sdmu/cdi_proquest_journals_2894687687

We investigate ‘digital contact tracing’ (DCT) apps developed in Austria and Norway and find their emergence, contestation and stabilisation as moments in which norms and values

 enrolment of a framework developed jointly by Apple and Google. Software became akin to a constitution that enshrined understandings of good citizenship into technological design, while also being a means through which geographies of power materialised. This article contributes to literature

A few special organizations, due to their data monopolies and resources, are able to decide which problems to solve and how to solve them. But even though data sharing creates a counterbalancing democratizing force, it must nevertheless be approached cautiously. Underserved organizations and groups must navigate difficult barriers related to technological complexity and legal risk. To examine what those common barriers are, one type of data sharing effort—data trusts—are examined, specifically the reports commenting on that effort. To address these practical issues, data governance technologies have a large role to play in democratizing data trusts safely and in a trustworthy manner. Yet technology is far from a silver bullet. It is dangerous to rely upon it. But technology that is no-code, flexible, and secure can help more responsibly operate data trusts.

This Note argues that this broad interpretation of section 7 to protect hate speech is contrary to public policy and does not properly account for employers' interest in not being associated with employees who engage in hate speech.

Google Search and the creation of ignorance: The case of the climate crisis,"Haider, Jutta ; Rödl, Malte",agnotology ; Climate change ; environmental communication ; Everyday life ; Ignorance ; Information Studies ; Library and Information Science ; Politics ; Social Sciences - Other Topics ; Social Sciences Interdisciplinary,"The article examines the relationship between commercial search engines, using Google Search as an example, and various forms of ignorance related to climate change. It draws on concepts from the field of agnotology to explore how environmental ignorances, and specifically related to the climate crisis, are shaped at the intersection of the logics of Google Search, everyday life and civil society/politics. Ignorance refers to a multi-facetted understanding of the culturally contingent ways in which something may not be known. Two research questions are addressed: How are environmental ignorances, and in particular related to the climate crisis, shaped at the intersection of the logics of Google Search, everyday life and civil society/politics? In what ways can we conceptualise Google's role as configured into the creation of ignorances? The argument is made through four vignettes, each of which explores and illustrates how Google Search is configured into a different kind of socially produced ignorance: (1) Ignorance through information avoidance: climate anxiety; (2) Ignorance through selective choice: gaming search terms; (3) Ignorance by design: algorithmically embodied emissions; (4) Ignorance through query suggestions: directing people to data voids. The article shows that while Google Search and its underlying algorithmic and commercial logic pre-figure these ignorances, they are also co-created and co-maintained by content producers, users and other human and non-human actors, as Google Search has become integral of social practices and ideas about them.

Fast Facts: Platforms From Personalization to Centralization,"Iliadis, Andrew ; Ford, Heather",Centralization ; Customization ; infrastructure ; knowledge graphs,"In recent years, there has been a noticeable shift in the economies of search and information retrieval concerning how the products of giant platform companies consolidate and represent facts directly in their search results. Concomitantly, media, communication, and information scholars have recently refocused on how media technology companies variably create, collect, connect, and commercialize data related to facts about the world and how such processes have implications for how we know the world. Such approaches often counter popular narratives that seek to frame the problems of platforms in terms of personalization and personalized content. While research on the personalization afforded by media is widespread, platforms also engage in the centralization of facts by merging web data representing factual claims and offering answers directly in search engines and virtual assistants’ results and responses (what we refer to as “fast facts”).

European Search? How to counter-imagine and counteract hegemonic search with European search engine projects,"Mager, Astrid","alternative search engines ; Counter-imaginaries ; Developers ; European values ; Profit maximization ; Social Sciences - Other Topics ; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary ; sociotechnical practices","This article investigates how developers of alternative search engines challenge increasingly corporate imaginaries of digital futures by building out counter-imaginaries of search engines devoted to social values instead of mere profit maximization. Drawing on three in-depth case studies of European search engines, it analyzes how search engine developers counter-imagine hegemonic search, what social values support their imaginaries, and how they are intertwined with their sociotechnical practices. This analysis shows that notions like privacy, independence, and openness appear to be fluid, context-dependent, and changing over time, leading to a certain “value pragmatics” that allows the projects to scale beyond their own communities of practice. It further shows how European values, and broader notions of Europe as “unified or pluralistic,” are constructed and co-produced with developers’ attempts to counter-imagine and counteract hegemonic search. To conclude, I suggest three points of intervention that may help alternative search engine projects, and digital technologies more generally, to not only make their counter-imaginaries more powerful, but also acquire the necessary resources to build their technologies and infrastructures accordingly. I finally discuss how “European values,” in all their richness and diversity, can contribute to this undertaking.",https://gslg-hb.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/46GSLG_BORAS/o2sdmu/cdi_sage_journals_10_1177_20539517231163173

Twenty-four undergraduate ESL learners undertaking an academic writing course participated in this study. They were tasked with a paired writing assignment as part of the coursework. Google Docs was used by each pair in revising their drafts before they submitted the final version of their academic essay. Adopting a mixed-methods approach, the qualitative phase involved conducting a textual analysis based on the drafts that the students prepared. The categories used to analyse the revisions were adapted from Kessler et al.'s (2012) analytical categories to understand the focus of learners' revisions. Students' responses to an online survey administered at the end of the course formed the quantitative data. The findings provide insights into the processes of collaborative online writing and students' perceived usefulness of Google Docs as a tool for collaboration.",https://gslg-hb.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/46GSLG_BORAS/o2sdmu/cdi_eric_primary_EJ1362815

Identifying these opportunities will necessitate the involvement of public health authorities and an appreciation of the diversity of objectives and scales across agencies at different levels (local, state, national, international).

However, Google's hegemony over search and the resulting implications are not necessarily accidental, arbitrary or (un)intentional. This article revisits Brin and Page's original paper, drawing on six of their key innovations, concerns and design choices (counting citations or backlinks, trusted user, advertising, personalization, usage data, smart algorithms) to explain the evolution of Google's hypertext search engine technologies through ‘moments of contingency’, which led to corporate lock-ins. Underpinned by analyses of patents, statements and secondary sources, it elucidates how early Google considerations and certain affordances not only came to shape the web (backlinks, trusted user, advertising) but subsequently facilitated contemporary surveillance capitalism. Building upon Zuboff's ‘Big Other’, it describes the ways in which Google as an infrastructure is intertwined with Big Data's platformization and the ad infinitum collection of usage data, beyond just personalization. This extraction and refinement of usage data as ‘behavioural surplus’ results in ‘deleterious consequences’: a ‘habit of automaticity,’ which shapes the trusted user through ‘ubiquitous googling’ and smart algorithms, whilst simultaneously generating prediction products for surveillance capitalism. Advancing Latour's ‘predicting the path’ of technological innovation, this cause-and-effect story contributes a new taxonomy of Google sociotechnical affordances to critical STS, media history and web search literature.",https://gslg-hb.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/46GSLG_BORAS/o2sdmu/cdi_doaj_primary_oai_doaj_org_article_efb3af2561d2423c906342c027b642ca

What happens when these services close down? The introduction of services might be carefully planned, but their closure may not benefit from the same degree of consideration. A more developed understanding of the effects of closures might make it possible to minimize negative consequences for users. This paper builds on sustainability, digital memories, and collaborative-work research through an empirical investigation of service closure. Fifty-five participants completed a questionnaire that solicited experiences of service closure and attitudes toward prospective closure. Through a qualitative analysis of participant responses, we synthesized six themes that reflected the practical and emotional effects of service closure on people: disempowerment, disconnection, loss of capability, trust, time and effort, and notice periods. We make suggestions for ways that service features related to these themes might be managed during closure, but also identify less tractable challenges: as part of this investigation, we introduce and develop the concept of service patinas to describe the important but entirely service-bound data that contextualize digital artefacts.",https://gslg-hb.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/46GSLG_BORAS/o2sdmu/cdi_acm_primary_3555617

This article assesses these conditions through a longitudinal study of 20 Nobel Prize winners in Chemistry, Economics, Medicine and Physics. Our results indicate that Google Scholar displays considerable stability over time. However, coverage for disciplines that have traditionally been poorly represented in Google Scholar (Chemistry and Physics) is increasing rapidly. Google Scholar’s coverage is also comprehensive; all of the 800 most cited publications by our Nobelists can be located in Google Scholar, although in four cases there are some problems with the results.

“There’s No Way Abraham Lincoln Could Work at Google”: Fox News and the Politics of Breaking Up Big Tech,"Medeiros, Ben",Antitrust ; Fox News ; Google ; Segments ; tech regulation,"This paper analyzes a corpus of segments from the Tucker Carlson Tonight program concerning “big tech” (focusing specifically on Google) and contextualizes this analysis within the political history of American media and technology regulation. Conservatives have long lamented the so-called liberal bias in media, but have also traditionally supported business deregulation and an antitrust approach narrowly concerned with consumer welfare. The textual analysis of Fox segments first shows that recurring complaints about the bias of Google's employees and executives is connected with its market dominance, and they frequently position corporations rather than government as the central threat to freedom. The solutions discussed, correspondingly, often favor greater structural intervention in the market to mitigate concentration’s deleterious political consequences. I show how the critique on Carlson’s show and recent attention to the issue from the executive branch represent a new manifestation of the theory of ideological evolution that Jack Balkin has called “ideological drift,” in which a political idea (in this case, the “Brandeisian” approach to antitrust law) changes valence in different material circumstances and thus finds new proponents.",https://gslg-hb.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/46GSLG_BORAS/9ip59g/cdi_proquest_journals_2608049324
Dialogic Collaboration across Sectors: Partnering for Sustainability,"Colaner, Nathan ; Imanaka, Jessica Ludescher ; Prussia, Gregory E. ",Collaboration ; Natural environment,"A substantial body of literature in the management discipline has evolved to make the case for and analyze the impacts of cross‐sector partnerships (CSPs). Yet, not all of these CSPs manifest the requisite collaborative propensities to achieve much more than superficial sustainability. Moreover, other disciplines like economics need to be brought to bear on analyses of such partnerships. In this article, we frame sustainable development challenges as collective action problems. We argue that over‐emphasizing the role of a single actor or institution will not yield genuine sustainability. Instead, we propose that a collaborative orientation is necessary for business managers as they deal with challenges as expansive and complex as those presented by goals of the sustainability of the natural environment. Cross‐sector collaborative partnerships (CSCPs) are needed to achieve collective responsibility, wherein dialogic CSCPs issue in a new paradigm of collaborative markets. Market‐based solutions that ignore or minimize the important contributions that may be made by government, academia, and civil society organizations must give way to new models of collaboration across sectors. We identity specific challenges and opportunities for cross‐sector collaboration and provide case examples. There are important limits to addressing environmental and ethics problems from a single sector focus, and we show how meaningful sustainability can be facilitated within a dialogic cross‐sector collaborative perspective.",https://gslg-hb.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/46GSLG_BORAS/9ip59g/cdi_proquest_journals_2251046651
Trace-Based Workload Generation and Execution,"Sfakianakis, Yannis ; Kanellou, Eleni ; Marazakis, Manolis ; Bilas, Angelos",Simulation ; Trace," Although major cloud providers have captured and published workload executions in the form of traces, it is not clear how to use them for workload generation on a wide range of existing platforms. A methodological challenge that remains is to generate and execute realistic datacenter workloads on any infrastructure, using information from available traces. In this paper, we propose Tracie, a methodology addressing this challenge, and introduce the tool supporting its implementation. We present all the necessary steps starting from a trace up to workload execution: analysis of datacenter traces, extraction of parameters, application selection, and scaling of a workload to match the capabilities of the underlying infrastructure. Our evaluation validates that Tracie can generate executable workloads that closely resemble their trace-based counterparts. For validation, we correlate the recorded system metrics of a trace against the actual execution. We find that the average system metrics of synthetic workloads differ at most 5% compared to the trace and that they are highly correlated at 70% on average.",https://gslg-hb.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/46GSLG_BORAS/9ip59g/cdi_springer_books_10_1007_978_3_030_85665_6_3
The four models of corporate entrepreneurship ,"Wolcott, Robert C. ; Lippitz, Michael J.",Business models ; Formal organization ; Innovations ; Market positioning ; R&D ; Research & development ; Studies,"How can established organizations build successful new businesses on an ongoing basis? In their study of nearly 30 corporations as diverse as Google, DuPont and Cargill, the authors identified two dimensions under the direct control of management that consistently differentiated how companies approach corporate entrepreneurship. The first is organizational ownership: Will the primary ownership for the creation of new businesses be focused in a designated group, or will it be diffused across the organization? The second is resource authority: Will projects be funded from a dedicated corporate pool of money or in an ad hoc manner, perhaps through business-unit budgets? Together the two dimensions generate a matrix with four basic models of corporate entrepreneurship: the opportunist, the enabler, the advocate and the producer. In the opportunist model (example: Zimmer Holdings), the company has no deliberate approach to corporate entrepreneurship, and new businesses are built mainly from the grassroots efforts of a few project champions. Enabler companies (example: Google) provide funding and senior executive attention to prospective projects. In the advocate model (example: DuPont), the company strongly evangelizes for corporate entrepreneurship, but business units provide the primary funding. Lastly, producer companies (example: Cargill) establish and support a full-service group with a mandate for corporate entrepreneurship. Each of the four models has a different objective, function and set of challenges. Whichever model is chosen, the crucial thing to remember is that corporate entrepreneurship needs to be nurtured and managed as a strategic, deliberate act.",https://gslg-hb.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/46GSLG_BORAS/9ip59g/cdi_proquest_journals_224967620

However, information on the Internet is mostly unregulated, ranging from factually correct to misleading or contradictory information. The objective of this study was to determine the quality of information available on World Wide Web on the topic of bunions. Methods: Websites were identified using 3 search engines (Google, Yahoo, and MSN) and the search term bunions. The first 30 websites in each search were analyzed. Websites were assessed using the validated DISCERN rating instrument to determine the quality of health content and treatment information. The DISCERN tool possesses moderate to very good strength of interobserver agreement, ranging from .41 to .82. Results: A total of 90 websites were assessed and studied. Forty-eight sites were duplicated, leaving 42 unique sites. Of these, 60% (25/42) provided patient-related information, 21% (9/42) were advertisements, 7% (3/42) promoted medical centers, 5% (2/42) were dead links, 5% (2/42) were news articles, and 2% (1/42) was doctor’s information. In determining the quality of unique sites, of a maximum score of 5, the average overall DISCERN score was 2.9 (range, 1.8 to 4.6). Only 24% (10/42) of websites were classified as “good” or “excellent.” Although most websites contained information on symptoms, causes, risk factors, investigations, and treatment options on bunions, 60% (25/42) did not provide adequate information on the benefits for each treatment, 45% (19/42) did not contain any risks of treatment, and 76% (32/42) did not describe how treatment choices affect overall quality of life. The sources of information were clear in 33% (14/42), and the date when this information was reviewed was given in only 50% (21/42). Only 29% (12/42) of websites had been updated within the past 2 years. Conclusions: Overall, the quality of patient information on bunions varies widely. We believe clinicians should guide patients in identifying the best possible and genuine information on the World Wide Web. Clinical Relevance: Patients are commonly using the internet as an information resource, in spite of the highly variable quality of this information.

More precisely, the article zooms in on plans put forward and financially supported by Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates and Google in order to show how these ventures manifest as (1) fanciful plans of leaving Earth and settling on other planets, (2) major geoengineering schemes in which the Earth System becomes the object of terraforming and (3) attempts to manipulate human behaviour via big data. Furthermore, the article argues that these three forms of desperate science fiction are deeply problematic, because they siphon attention away from important democratic conversations about which degrowth-models societies across the planet should pursue and seek to develop. To change this, the article argues, we need to see the three forms of desperate science fiction advanced by Musk, Bezos, Gates and Google for what they are: deceptive attempts to preserve a deeply unjust and destructive economic system.",https://gslg-hb.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/46GSLG_BORAS/9ip59g/cdi_informaworld_taylorfrancis_310_1080_14735784_2023_2257404
"Digging into Google Earth: An analysis of ""Crisis in Darfur""","Parks, Lisa",Critical analysis ; Darfur ; Google Earth ; International conflicts ; Mapping ; Spatial analysis,"Google publicists have suggested the Crisis in Darfur is an example of the Google Earth software’s “success at tangibly impacting what is happening on the ground.” Yet whether or not Google Earth’s interface, along with a medley of other media representations of the conflict, have impacted events on the ground or led to coherent policies of humanitarian intervention remains open to debate. This article draws upon critical approaches from media studies—namely discourse analysis—to analyze several aspects of the Google Earth/USHMM Crisis in Darfur project. While this project was no doubt developed with the noble intention of generating international awareness about widespread violence that has recently occurred in the Darfur region, it is important to evaluate how representations of global conflicts are changing with uses of new information technologies and whether such representations can actually achieve their desired impacts or effects. The article begins with a discussion of the Crisis in Darfur project’s history, proceeds to analyze some of the press coverage of the project and then moves to a critique of the layer using four categories of analysis: (1) the shifting role of satellite image; (2) the temporality of the interface; (3) the practice of conflict branding; and (4) the practice of “information intervention.” Throughout the article, I explore how the presentation of Darfur-related materials through Google Earth reproduces problematic Western tropes of African tragedy and misses an opportunity to generate public literacy around satellite images. I also consider how humanitarianism is intertwined with digital and disaster capitalism, and suggest that this instance of “information intervention” makes patently clear that high visual capital alone cannot resolve global conflicts.",https://gslg-hb.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/46GSLG_BORAS/9ip59g/cdi_proquest_miscellaneous_37191364
Machine Learning and the Platformization of the Military: A Study of Google's Machine Learning Platform TensorFlow,"Hoijtink, Marijn ; Planqué-van Hardeveld, Anneroos","Infrastructure ; Language processing ; Natural language interfaces ; Security ; Surveillance ; Teams ; van Dijck, José","Against the background of the growing use of machine learning (ML) based technologies by the military, our article calls for an analytical perspective on ML platforms to understand how ML proliferates across the military and to what effects. Adopting a material–technical perspective on platforms as developed within new media studies, and bringing this literature to critical security studies, we suggest that a focus on platforms and the technical work they do is needed to understand how digital technologies are emerging and shaping security practices. Through a detailed study of Google's open-source ML platform TensorFlow and a discussion of the US Department of Defense Algorithmic Warfare Cross-Functional Team, or Project Maven, we make two broader contributions. First, we identify a broader “platformization” of the military, with which we refer to the growing involvement and permeation of the (technomaterial) ML platform as the infrastructure that enables new practices of decentralized and experimental algorithm development across the military. Second, we draw out how this platformization is accompanied by new entanglements between the military and actors in the corporate domain, especially Big Tech, which play a key role in this context, as well as the open-source community that is organized around these platforms.",https://gslg-hb.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/46GSLG_BORAS/9ip59g/cdi_proquest_journals_2677262564
Google Capitalism ,"Fuchs, Christian",Audience Commodity ; Google ; Internet Prosumer Commodification ; Media and Communication Studies ; Prosumer Commodity,"This paper analyzes Google’s political economy. In section 2, Google’s cycle of capital accumulation is explained and the role of surveillance in Google’s form of capital accumulation is explained. In section 3, the discussion if Google is “evil” is taken up. Based on Dallas Smythe’s concept of the audience commodity, the role of the notion of Internet prosumer commodification is stressed.",https://gslg-hb.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/46GSLG_BORAS/9ip59g/cdi_doaj_primary_oai_doaj_org_article_605e1a0ae27749038d56b45db41df3ef
Don’t Be Evil: Should We Use Google in Schools?,"Krutka, Daniel G. ; Smits, Ryan M. ; Willhelm, Troy A.",Learning and Instruction ; Legal Problems ; Original Paper ; Technology Uses in Education,"Google is a multinational technology company whose massive advertising profits have allowed them to expand into many areas, including education. While the company has increasingly faced public scrutiny, the use of Google software and hardware in schools has often resulted in little debate. In this paper, we conduct a technoethical audit of Google to address ethical, legal, democratic, economic, technological, and pedagogical concerns educators, students, and community members might consider. We describe how Google extracts personal data from students, skirts laws intended to protect them, targets them for profits, obfuscates the company's intent in their Terms of Service, recommends harmful information, and distorts students’ knowledge. We propose that educators and scholars more closely interrogate the tools of Google and other technology companies to move toward more democratic and just uses of technology in schools.",https://gslg-hb.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/46GSLG_BORAS/9ip59g/cdi_pubmedcentral_primary_oai_pubmedcentral_nih_gov_7972328
