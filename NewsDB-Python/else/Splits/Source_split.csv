Specifically, Google News is taken up as a case study because of its popularity and its insistence on not using human editors. Conflicting normative articulations of journalism arise between traditional news and news search engines: the former promotes an interpretive order through purposefully structuring the news product to create a meaningful map of what is important, while the latter promotes diversity through creating easy access to different viewpoints and multiple versions of a story without legitimating one view over another. As a result, tensions form around questions of what journalism does and what it should do.']","['ISSN: 0163-4437', ' EISSN: 1460-3675', ' DOI: 10.1177/0163443707084346', ' CODEN: MCSOEC']", Sociological Abstracts,,https://gslg-hb.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/46GSLG_BORAS/o2sdmu/cdi_webofscience_primary_000252153500009

Public controversies over the results returned by search engines to politically and morally charged queries evidence the growing importance, and politics, of corporations’ content moderation activities. Despite public concern with the political and moral impact of search engine results, search engine providers have resisted requests to alter their content moderation practices, responding instead with explanations, directions, and assistance that place responsibility for altering search results on information providers and seekers.

Public objections are grounded in well-founded imaginaries of search engines not merely as providers of relevant information, but at least with respect to human rights atrocities such as the holocaust, as stewards of authoritative historical truth. Corporate resistance to altering the search script is rooted in a deep commitment to engineering logics which tether search engine performance to observational measures of user satisfaction, coupled with limited recognition of the role search results play in constructing the need being satisfied and a general reluctance to diverge from the search script to remove content protected by the First Amendment.

The study adds complexity to the analysis of data voids, expanding the framework of investigation outside the USA context by concentrating on Germany and Sweden. Building on previous big data analytics addressing the politics of exclusion, the study proposes a catalogue of queries concerning the issue of migration in both Germany and Sweden on a continuum from mainstream to extreme-right vocabularies. This catalogue of queries enables specific and localized queries to identify data voids. The results show that a search engine's reliance on source popularity may lead to extreme-right sources appearing in top positions.

Drawing on three in-depth case studies of European search engines, it analyzes how search engine developers counter-imagine hegemonic search, what social values support their imaginaries, and how they are intertwined with their sociotechnical practices. This analysis shows that notions like privacy, independence, and openness appear to be fluid, context-dependent, and changing over time, leading to a certain “value pragmatics” that allows the projects to scale beyond their own communities of practice. It further shows how European values, and broader notions of Europe as “unified or pluralistic,” are constructed and co-produced with developers’ attempts to counter-imagine and counteract hegemonic search. To conclude, I suggest three points of intervention that may help alternative search engine projects, and digital technologies more generally, to not only make their counter-imaginaries more powerful, but also acquire the necessary resources to build their technologies and infrastructures accordingly.

These connected devices are heterogeneous. They have different standards and technologies which communicate through different protocols. Therefore, the implementation of IoT on a large scale is difficult due to these heterogeneity challenges. This motivated us to overcome the scaling problem of IoT by identifying the challenges from the literature and providing solutions. This study is based on the identification of the heterogeneous challenges with solutions via a systematic literature review. A total of 81 primary sources were selected. After extracting and synthesizing the data, we identified 14 different IoT heterogeneity challenges.

In this article we describe the emergence of the professional field of privacy engineering to enact this shift in digital governance. We argue that privacy engineering forms part of a broader techno-regulatory imaginary through which (fundamental) rights protections become increasingly future-oriented and anticipatory. The techno-regulatory imaginary is described in terms of three distinct privacy articulations, implemented in technologies, organizations, and standardizations. We pose two interrelated questions: What happens to rights as they become implemented and enacted in new sites, through new instruments and professional practices?

Twenty-four undergraduate ESL learners undertaking an academic writing course participated in this study. They were tasked with a paired writing assignment as part of the coursework. Google Docs was used by each pair in revising their drafts before they submitted the final version of their academic essay. Adopting a mixed-methods approach, the qualitative phase involved conducting a textual analysis based on the drafts that the students prepared. The categories used to analyse the revisions were adapted from Kessler et al.'s (2012) analytical categories to understand the focus of learners' revisions. Students' responses to an online survey administered at the end of the course formed the quantitative data. The findings provide insights into the processes of collaborative online writing and students' perceived usefulness of Google Docs as a tool for collaboration.""]","['ISSN: 2155-7098', ' EISSN: 2155-7101', ' DOI: 10.4018/IJCALLT.310077']",ProQuest Central,,https://gslg-hb.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/46GSLG_BORAS/o2sdmu/cdi_eric_primary_EJ1362815

This article, in contrast, approaches gender from a behind the screen perspective. How algorithms and platforms are created, designed, and maintained, the affordances they provide for users and how they govern the ways users communicate with each other, has a major impact on digital communication. However, it is mostly men who create these technologies. Our study approaches technologies as socio-cultural, departing from the concept of network media logic. Empirically, it is based on (1) the review of a diverse body of literature from the history of programming, professional sociology, and computer science and documents such as the diversity reports from tech giants, as well as on (2) 64 semi-structured expert interviews conducted with male and female programmers in seven countries over a time-period of four years. Results show that the gender gap continues to run deep.
